    "Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Ans. When we try to inherit a class from multiple classes then it is called as multiple inheritance OR When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case.\n",

    "Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "Ans. Delegation is an object oriented technique (also called a design pattern). Let's say you have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. You can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method you're interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x. \n",

    "Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "Ans. Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component.It enables creating complex types by combining objects of different classes. It means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component. This type of relationship is known as Has-A Relation.\n",

    "Q4. What are bound methods and how do we use them?\n",
    "Ans. A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions. In Python 3 and newer versions of python, all functions in the class are by default bound methods. \n",

    "Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "Ans. Pseudoprivate attributes are also useful in larger frameworks or tools, both to avoid introducing new method names that might accidentally hide definitions elsewhere in the class tree and to reduce the chance of internal methods being replaced by names defined lower in the tree.this feature is mostly intended to avoid namespace collisions in instances, not to restrict access to names in general.\n"
